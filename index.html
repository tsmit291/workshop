        <p><b>Where I'm from: </b>Texas-born, North Carolina-raised, (a brief stint in Denver where I attended Galvanize), and currently living here!</p>
        <p><b>Fun Facts:</b> I'm left handed, I love to clean, I enjoy cycling and yoga, and I will pet every dog I ever meet. Oh, and I am the brigade captain for Code for Phoenix.</p>

      <h2>All About Me (at work)</h2>
      <div>
      <p>I work for Allstate Insurance in a startup-like department called CompoZed Labs. There are roughly 35 developers, designers and product managers in our lab- and they are all amazing! We are an XP shop, which means we practice Extreme Programming (test-driven-development, pair-programming and the agile methodology). The current product team I am on writes in Golang and Javascript.</p>

      <h2>What Got Me Developing</h2>
      <p>My first job was the Marketing Director for a local print publication in Charlotte, NC. After being exhausted from 60+ hour weeks and sick of planning events, I transitioned to a Hospitality company where I was responsible for building mobile apps for corporate conferences and then traveling onsite to manage the use of the apps. I LOVED traveling to fancy hotels and working with clients, but what I was really passionate about was learning how the apps we built with templates <i>really</i> worked. I begged my boss to let me code, and eventually, he let me manage our client's wordpress landing pages. After a few tutorials and joining a civic tech group called Code for Charlotte, I was hooked- and told my parents I was going to apply to Galvanize's full stack program in Denver. I studied, applied, and got in! The rest is history, and I wouldn't have it any other way!</p>
